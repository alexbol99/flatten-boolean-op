# Example: @flatten-js/boolean-op in a browser as es6 module

This example illustrates usage of boolean-op package together with @flatten-js/core package in a browser supporting ```script type="module"``` tag.
It works "as is" without transpiling in most of the modern browsers.
Project uses https://unpkg tool to deliver the packages from npm as es6 modules.
Then we can import classes and functions directly from the module.
 
## Usage

Move index.html file into browser and see svg graphics created

## Known issues

Does not work in IE.
